    "\n",
    "The coronavirus is without a doubt one of the biggest headlines as well as the biggest health issue to society currently. Not only has the first fatality from the virus in the U.S. occurred in Washington, the governor has also declared a state of emergency. Because of how severe the issue is becoming, we believe that computing data regarding the virus is a worthwhile endeavor. Understanding whether certain factors attribute strongly to contraction or analyzing how the virus has traveled could possibly give us the knowledge to predict and prevent contraction."

    "\n",
    "For the analysis of the spread of the virus, we will use time series tables of confirmed cases in different locations, and analyze the growth of confirmed/death/recovered cases by joining tables of differing dates together using pandas. Afterwards, we will then use the data and try to predict the growth of cases in the next few days on a per location or country basis. We will plot the relations of existing data using seaborn, and visualization using geopandas.\n",
    "For attribute analysis, we will extract information of confirmed patients such as gender, age, location, etc using pandas, and visualize the data on pandas. Then, we will use the extracted data to train a decision tree classifier and attempt to estimate the likelihood of becoming infected based on the aforementioned attributes. \n"

Interpret the results: if the answers are unexpected, then see whether you can find an explanation for them, such as an external factor that your analysis did not account for. Include some visualization of your results (a graph, plot, bar chart, etc.). These plots should be created programmaticaly in the code you submit. If you have to create plots by hand using a program like Excel, you must provide a good reason why it was not possible to create the plot you wanted using Python. \n",
